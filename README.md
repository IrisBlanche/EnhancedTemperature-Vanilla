# EnhancedTemperature Mainmod
This mod brings back the temperature system to Starbound.  

##*** DISCLAIMER ***
Installing this mod is a one-way trip. Already generated planets won't be affected unless you import them. Characters and their shipworlds are compatible so they can be kept. However your character will get incompatible when removing this mod. Make sure you backup your storage folder before installing this mod!

##* How to import worlds *
This is done automatically. You don't need to do anything :)

##* What is EnhancedTemperature? *
EnhancedTemperature is a mod that brings back the old temperature system from the beta with some heavy changes. This mod currently features:
- 8 new status effects
- Exposure system
- Hypothermia system
- Hyperthermia system
- Advanced heat/hybrid source detection

##* What about multiplayer? *
If you use this mod in multiplayer it is no longer required to have the mod used by everyone (pre 1.2 users could encounter logspam about missing biome status effects though)

##* How does it affect gameplay? *
This mod affect your exploration experience by making it harder. Exploring cold planets will force you to stay warm, exploring hot planets will force you to stay cool. Also some equipment parts will provide certain bonuses.
Missions are excluded from this system and will provide a fallback temperature of 25C. Liquid stats and status effect stats will still aplly.

##* Is there an ingame manual? *
Yes. A detailed description can be found ingame as a codex. It will introduce you to the new temperature system and also give you information about planet temperatures. The codex can be found in your shiplocker or if you already have a character simply craft it for 1 pixel.

##* How to start the mod? *
To start the mod take the EHT - Starter from your shiplocker or if you already have a character simply craft it for 1 pixel. You decide when to start it so it is possible to play a character without the system even if the mod is installed.

##* What mods are supported? *
Every racemod is partially compatible with this mod. Added objects won't be detected as heat sources without patch.
Every mod that changes the shipworld is partially compatible. Added objects won't be detected as heat sources without patch.
Every mod that adds new biomes will be incompatible(1). You can request a compatibiliy patch if you want.
Every compatibiliy patch will also add their information to their own EHT Codex so you will always have an overview about the EHT changes for each supported mod.

######(1)If you're using new biomes that aren't supported by this mod you will have a fallback temperature of 25C on this planet so the mod won't stop working.

##* Found a bug? *
If you find a bug please provide a detailed description what you were doing and attach a copy of your starbound.log. Without this information i'm not able to help you.

##* Have questions? *
Most things are explained in the ingame codex so make sure to read it first.
It is possible that i forgot something to add in the codex. If you find something please let me know.
