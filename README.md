# EnhancedTemperature Mainmod

This mod brings back the temperature system to starbound.  


## DISCLAIMER
Installing this mod is a one-way trip. Already generated planets won't be affected unless you import them. Characters and their shipworlds are compatible so they can be kept. However your character will get incompatible when removing this mod. Make sure you backup your storage folder before installing this mod!


## How to import worlds (NEW in 1.1)
To import a world you need the compatibiliy card for this biome. It won't work on planets that already have their EHT information set. It won't work on the shipworld either.
The cards can't be crafted and MUST be spawned in admin mode. To spawn the codex which holds the biome compatibiliy card names type:
Code:

/spawnitem ib_eht_admin-codex

This codex will also get the biome information from the compatibiliy patches which will be added with 1.2 using the patch format. If you play on a server this step must be done by a server administrator!
The EHT compatibiliy card will be consumed when the biome information was added successful.
WARNING! Improper use of the compatibiliy cards will cause your imported planet to have wrong temperatures, or in other words: the wrong biome preset.
This can't be reverted so make SURE you use the right one! I'm not responsible if you break your planets EHT information with this.


## What is EnhancedTemperature?
EnhancedTemperature is a mod that brings back the old temperature system from the beta with some heavy changes. This mod currently features:
- 8 new status effects
- 18 new environmental effects for planet based temperatures
- Exposure system
- Hypothermia system
- Hyperthermia system
- Advanced heat/hybrid source detection


## What about multiplayer?
If you use this mod in multiplayer you must make sure that the server and the other players as well do have this mod. Otherwise it can happen that they can't visit planets generated with this mod active or the environmental effects aren't applied which would result in a 25C (fallback) temperature all the time.


## How does it affect gameplay?
This mod affect your exploration experience by making it harder. Exploring cold planets will force you to stay warm, exploring hot planets will force you to stay cool. Also some equipment parts will provide certain bonuses.
Since you're not able to place objects in missions the missions are excluded from this system and will provide a fallback temperature of 25C.


## Is there an ingame manual?
Yes a detailed description can be found ingame as a codex. It will introduce you to the new temperature system and also give you information about planet temperatures. The codex can be found in your shiplocker or if you already have a character simply craft it for 1 pixel.


## How to start the mod?
To start the mod take the EHT - Starter from your shiplocker or if you already have a character simply craft it for 1 pixel. You decide when to start it so it is possible to play a character without the system even if the mod is installed.


## What mods are supported?
Every racemod should be compatible with this mod.  
Every mod that changes the shipworld should be compatible.  
Mods that add new biomes will be incompatible. You can request a compatibiliy patch if you want. A FU compatibiliy patch will be released later.
If you're using new biomes that aren't supported by this mod you will have a fallback temperature of 25C on this planet so the mod won't stop working.  
Every compatibiliy patch will also add their information to their own EHT [MOD] Compat - Codex so you will always have overview about the EHT changes for each supported mod.


## Found a bug?
If you find a bug please provide a detailed description what you were doing and attach a copy of your starbound.log Without this information i'm not able to help you.


## Have questions?
Most things are explained in the ingame codex so make sure to read it first.
It is possible that i forgot something to add in the codex. If you find something please let me know.
