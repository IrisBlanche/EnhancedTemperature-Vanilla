You should read it because if you don't pay attention to your surroundings and of course the planets main biome you can suffer a quick death.\u000a\u000aThe best would be reading this book on your ship. SAIL is programmed to keep a temperature of 25C so you won't suffer from any negative effects on your ship.","^cyan; * What is this mod?^white;\u000a\u000aWhen using the ^green;EHT-Starter^white; you get a new quest in your questlog. Tracking this quest will allow you to keep track of your actual exposure level and the current planet temperature. This should help you surviving on all those planets.\u000a\u000aMissions are excluded from the calculation so they will always offer a 25C temperature to prevent them being too hard.","^cyan; * What is exposure?^white;\u000a\u000aThe exposure determines your current hypothermia\/hyperthermia level. SAIL will always warn you when you reach a critical point. You will also have status effects based on the current exposure level. Some effects are harmless but others will be lethal. The exposure depends on the current biome temperature and will stop at certain levels so you won't suffer from negative effects when it's slightly warm or cold.","^cyan; * What is exposure?^white;\u000a\u000aWind and weather will also affect the current temperature and of course your exposure. Also your current altitude on the planet will affect the current temperature and exposure. Also watch out when digging for core fragments because the planet cores will be very hot and can raise your hyperthermia level quickly! Also watch out for the current time on the planet because dependend on the current time the temperature will change.","^cyan; * The status effects^white;\u000a\u000aThe following pages will introduce you to the status effects used by this mod. These effects will have an impact on late-game so don't go out unprepared!","^cyan; * The status effects^white;\u000a\u000a^orange;Hyperthermia Level 0^white;\u000aExposurelevel: between 0 and 25 \u000aEffects: none\u000a\u000a^orange;Hyperthermia Level 1^white;\u000aExposurelevel: between 25 and 50 \u000aEffects: no energy restore, Hyperthermia +10%\u000a\u000a^orange;Hyperthermia Level 2^white;\u000aExposurelevel: between 50 and 75\u000aEffects: slight energy drain, Hyperthermia +25%","^cyan; * The status effects^white;\u000a\u000a^orange;Hyperthermia Level 3^white;\u000aExposurelevel: between 75 and 100\u000aEffects: moderate energy drain, moderate health drain, Hyperthermia +25%\u000a^red;This effect is lethal!\u000a\u000aIt should be avoided to get this one!","^cyan; * The status effects^white;\u000a\u000a^orange;Hypothermia Level 0^white;\u000aExposurelevel: between 0 and -25 \u000aEffects: none\u000a\u000a^orange;Hypothermia Level 1^white;\u000aExposurelevel: between -25 and -50 \u000aEffects: no energy restore, Hypothermia +10%\u000a\u000a^orange;Hypothermia Level 2^white;\u000aExposurelevel: between -50 and -75\u000aEffects: slight energy drain, slower movement, Hypothermia +25%","^cyan; * The status effects^white;\u000a\u000a^orange;Hypothermia Level 3^white;\u000aExposurelevel: between -75 and -100\u000aEffects: moderate energy drain, moderate health drain, slow movement, Hypothermia +25%\u000a^red;This effect is lethal!\u000a\u000aIt should be avoided to get this one!","^cyan; * How to affect exposure?^white;\u000a\u000aExposure can be affected by heat sources (e.g. campfires, torches) and by Hybrid sources (e.g. vents) and liquids.\u000aA heat source will always increase exposure by a fixed value dependend on the current temperature so it wouldn't be a good idea using campfires on a hot planet.\u000aHybrid sources will however try to get your exposure to 15 regardless of temperature but won't work in liquid.","^cyan; * How to affect exposure?^white;\u000a\u000aLiquids will have different impact on your exposure which is dependend on the current biome temperature. Most of them will affect the exposure by decreasing the current level (except lava). So water can be a problem on very cold planets. If you run into problems you can always beam up to your ship to get your exposure level back to a good level.","^cyan; * What Equipment should i use?^white;\u000a\u000aCertain equipment parts will affect your exposure base level.\u000aThese stats will not be applied in cosmetic slots.\u000a\u000a^orange;Snow infantry set^white;\u000a+3 base exposure for each piece\u000a\u000a^orange;Penguin Suit^white;\u000a+3 base exposure for each piece\u000a\u000a^orange;Alpaca Suit^white;\u000a+3 base exposure for each piece","^cyan; * What Equipment should i use?^white;\u000a\u000a^orange;Ushanka^white;\u000a+3 base exposure\u000a\u000a^orange;Desert Set^white;\u000a-3 base exposure for each piece\u000a\u000a^orange;Sombrero^white;\u000a-3 base exposure\u000a\u000a^orange;Pyramid head^white;\u000a-3 base exposure","^cyan; * What Equipment should i use?^white;\u000a\u000a^orange;Boiler^white;\u000a+4 base exposure","^cyan; * Planet temperatures^white;\u000a\u000aHere you will find a list about the surface temperatures on each planet.
