		"^cyan; * What is this mod?^white;\n\nThis book introduces you to the new temperature system. You should read it because if you don't pay attention to your surroundings and of course the planets type you can suffer a quick death.\n\nThe best would be reading this book on your ship. SAIL is programmed to keep a temperature of 25C so you won't suffer from any negative effects on your ship.",
		"^cyan; * What is this mod?^white;\n\nWhen using the ^green;EHT-Starter^white; you get a new quest in your questlog. Tracking this quest will allow you to keep track of your actual exposure level and the current planet temperature. This should help you surviving on all those planets.\n\nUnknown biomes and planet types are excluded from the calculation so they will always offer a 25C temperature to prevent them being too hard or having wrong values.",
		"^cyan; * What is exposure?^white;\n\nThe exposure determines your current hypothermia/hyperthermia level. SAIL will always warn you when you reach a critical point. You will also have status effects based on the current exposure level. Some effects are harmless but others will be lethal. The exposure depends on the current biome temperature and will stop at certain levels so you won't suffer from negative effects when it's slightly warm or cold.",
		"^cyan; * What is exposure?^white;\n\nWind and weather will also affect the current temperature and of course your exposure. Also your current altitude on the planet will affect the current temperature and exposure. Also watch out when digging for core fragments because the planet cores will be very hot and can raise your hyperthermia level quickly! Also watch out for the current time on the planet because dependend on the current time the temperature will change.",
		"^cyan; *  Exposure effects^white;\n\nThe following pages will introduce you to the status effects used by this mod. These effects will have an impact on late-game so don't go out unprepared!",
		"^cyan; *  Exposure effects^white;\n\n^orange;Hyperthermia Level 0^white;\nExposurelevel: between 0 and 25 \nEffects: none\n\n^orange;Hyperthermia Level 1^white;\nExposurelevel: between 25 and 50 \nEffects: no energy restore, Hyperthermia +10%\n\n^orange;Hyperthermia Level 2^white;\nExposurelevel: between 50 and 75\nEffects: slight energy drain, Hyperthermia +25%",
		"^cyan; *  Exposure effects^white;\n\n^orange;Hyperthermia Level 3^white;\nExposurelevel: between 75 and 100\nEffects: moderate energy drain, moderate health drain, Hyperthermia +25%\n^red;This effect is lethal!\n\nIt should be avoided to get this one!",

		"^cyan; *  Exposure effects^white;\n\n^orange;Hypothermia Level 3^white;\nExposurelevel: between -75 and -100\nEffects: moderate energy drain, moderate health drain, slow movement, Hypothermia +25%\n^red;This effect is lethal!\n\nIt should be avoided to get this one!",
		"^cyan; * How to affect exposure?^white;\n\nExposure can be affected by heat sources (e.g. campfires, torches) and by Hybrid sources (e.g. vents) and liquids.\nA heat source will always increase exposure by a fixed value dependend on the current temperature so it wouldn't be a good idea using campfires on a hot planet.\nHybrid sources will however try to get your exposure to 15 regardless of temperature but won't work in liquid.",
		"^cyan; * How to affect exposure?^white;\n\nLiquids will have different impact on your exposure which is dependend on the current biome temperature. Most of them will affect the exposure by decreasing the current level (except lava). So water can be a problem on very cold planets. If you run into problems you can always beam up to your ship to get your exposure level back to a good level.",
		"^cyan; * What Equipment should i use?^white;\n\nYour exposure protection will increase with the armor rating provided by your armor.\nThe higher your armor rating the longer it takes that the exposure will change.\n\nCertain vanity items will provide additional exposure protection when placed in the costume slot. So you can keep your armor when exploring extreme colde or extreme hot planets.",
		"^cyan; * What Equipment should i use?^white;\n\nThese vanity parts will affect your exposure protection.\nThese stats will only be applied in cosmetic slots!\n\n^orange;Snow infantry set^white;\n+3 base exposure for each piece\n\n^orange;Penguin Suit^white;\n+3 base exposure for each piece\n\n^orange;Alpaca Suit^white;\n+3 base exposure for each piece",

		"^cyan; * Planet temperatures^white;\n\nOn the next pages you will find a list about the surface temperatures of each planet. Spacelayer and corelayer of the planet will always have extreme temperatures regardless of the planets main biome so be careful when aproaching those layers!\n\nAlso keep an eye open for extreme hot/cold planets. Without proper equipment you will suffer a quick death.",

		"^cyan; * Heat sources^white;\n\nHere you will find a list about the actual implemented heat sources.\nA heat source will increase your base exposure level when in range. The closer you're the higher the effect. More heat sources means higher base exposure so be careful when placing too much of them. The base range is around 10 blocks. However they won't work when placed in any liquid or when you are in a liquid. Also no blocks should be between you and the source.",
