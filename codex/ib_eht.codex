You should read it because if you don't pay attention to your surroundings and of course the planets type you can suffer a quick death.\u000a\u000aThe best would be reading this book on your ship. SAIL is programmed to keep a temperature of 25C so you won't suffer from any negative effects on your ship.","^cyan; * What is this mod?^white;\u000a\u000aWhen using the ^green;EHT-Starter^white; you get a new quest in your questlog. Tracking this quest will allow you to keep track of your actual exposure level and the current planet temperature. This should help you surviving on all those planets.\u000a\u000aUnknown biomes and planet types are excluded from the calculation so they will always offer a 25C temperature to prevent them being too hard or having wrong values.","^cyan; * What is exposure?^white;\u000a\u000aThe exposure determines your current hypothermia\/hyperthermia level. SAIL will always warn you when you reach a critical point. You will also have status effects based on the current exposure level. Some effects are harmless but others will be lethal. The exposure depends on the current biome temperature and will stop at certain levels so you won't suffer from negative effects when it's slightly warm or cold.","^cyan; * What is exposure?^white;\u000a\u000aWind and weather will also affect the current temperature and of course your exposure. Also your current altitude on the planet will affect the current temperature and exposure. Also watch out when digging for core fragments because the planet cores will be very hot and can raise your hyperthermia level quickly! Also watch out for the current time on the planet because dependend on the current time the temperature will change.","^cyan; *  Exposure effects^white;\u000a\u000aThe following pages will introduce you to the status effects used by this mod.

Most of them will affect the exposure by decreasing the current level (except lava). So water can be a problem on very cold planets. If you run into problems you can always beam up to your ship to get your exposure level back to a good level.","^cyan; * What Equipment should i use?^white;\u000a\u000aYour exposure protection will increase with the armor rating provided by your armor.\u000aThe higher your armor rating the longer it takes that the exposure will change.\u000a\u000aCertain vanity items will provide additional exposure protection when placed in the costume slot.
