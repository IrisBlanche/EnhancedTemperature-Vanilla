Make sure you backup your storage folder before installing this mod!\n\n* How to import worlds *\nThis is done automatically. You don't need to do anything :)\n\n* What is EnhancedTemperature? *\nEnhancedTemperature is a mod that brings back the old temperature system from the beta with some heavy changes.

Exploring cold planets will force you to stay warm, exploring hot planets will force you to stay cool. Also some equipment parts will provide certain bonuses.\nMissions are excluded from this system and will provide a fallback temperature of 25C. Liquid stats and status effect stats will still aplly.\n\n* Is there an ingame manual? *\nYes. A detailed description can be found ingame as a codex. It will introduce you to the new temperature system and also give you information about planet temperatures. The codex can be found in your shiplocker or if you already have a character simply craft it for 1 pixel.\n\n* How to start the mod? *\nTo start the mod take the EHT - Starter from your shiplocker or if you already have a character simply craft it for 1 pixel. You decide when to start it so it is possible to play a character without the system even if the mod is installed.\n\n* What mods are supported? *\nEvery racemod is partially compatible with this mod. Added objects won't be detected as heat sources without patch.\nEvery mod that changes the shipworld is partially compatible. Added objects won't be detected as heat sources without patch.\nEvery mod that adds new biomes will be incompatible(1). You can request a compatibiliy patch if you want.\nEvery compatibiliy patch will also add their information to their own EHT Codex so you will always have an overview about the EHT changes for each supported mod.\n\n(1)If you're using new biomes that aren't supported by this mod you will have a fallback temperature of 25C on this planet so the mod won't stop working.\n\n\n* Found a bug? *\nIf you find a bug please provide a detailed description what you were doing and attach a copy of your starbound.log. Without this information i'm not able to help you.\n\n* Have questions? *\nMost things are explained in the ingame codex so make sure to read it first.\nIt is possible that i forgot something to add in the codex.
